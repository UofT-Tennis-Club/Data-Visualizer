# Data_Visualizer
Visualize data for the tennis club for number of people who attended practices. 

## Initial goals
* Determine the number of total participants
* Determine the number of first year, second year, third year, etc who attended our practices
* The turnover rate (those who only attended once)
* Calculate the probability that a student only attends one practice
* Calculate the number of followers we have that are also following the badminton club
* Calculate the number of followers who are on our mailing list but who aren't active
* Project data onto charts for viewing by others. 
* Perhaps incorporate R to do statistical analysis. Distributions and find interesting data.
* Present data developed into a report for the UTSU to support the 2022-2023 funding cycle. 
* Automate calculations of followers, and indicate which type of posts work and which don't.
