* Project data onto charts for viewing by others. 
* Perhaps incorporate R to do statistical analysis. Distributions and find interesting data.
* Present data developed into a report for the UTSU to support the 2022-2023 funding cycle. 
* Automate calculations of followers, and indicate which type of posts work and which don't.
